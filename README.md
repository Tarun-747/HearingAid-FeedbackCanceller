# Improved Delayless Multiband-Structured Subband Adaptive Feedback Canceller for Digital Hearing Aids
<pr>
## Introduction <pr>
This project focuses on improving acoustic feedback cancellation in digital hearing aids using a proportionate delayless multiband-structured subband adaptive feedback canceller. Acoustic feedback is a common issue in behind-the-ear (BTE) digital hearing aids, which can significantly degrade the performance of the device. This project implements an adaptive filter to address this issue effectively.
